Business card made by Gtrx

# Concept
A modern, sleek and usable business card with an NFC tag, QR code and the ability to open a website/copy text to clipboard once plugged into a computer.

# Description
The card uses an IC that acts as an NFC tag (M24LR04E-R) which can be scanned by any NFC compatible device. After scanning, the device opens the website (Gtrxengineering.com). The NFC tag can work without the board being powered. Once the board is plugged into a computer, one of the 2 switches can be pressed. Depending on which switch is pressed, either the website will open or the email address will be copied to clipboard. The QR code also opens the website.

The website and email aren't "real" yet :P.
